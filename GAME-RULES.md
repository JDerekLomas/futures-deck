# FUTURES DECK
## Rules & Design Framework

---

## Core Components

| Deck | Count | Color | Purpose |
|------|-------|-------|---------|
| Domain | 10 | Blue | Where the technology impacts |
| Wellbeing | 10 | Yellow | What human dimension is affected |
| Technology | 8 | Red | Quantum capability in question |
| Modifier | 6 | Black/Green/Orange | Timeline acceleration or delay |
| Wildcard | 6 | Gradient | Cross-cutting disruptions |
| Outcome Coin | 1 | Gold | Positive or negative result |

---

## Basic Play (Solo Contemplation)

**Setup:** Shuffle each deck separately. Place face-down.

**Draw Sequence:**
1. **DOMAIN** → Where does it hit?
2. **WELLBEING** → What's at stake?
3. **FLIP COIN** → Positive or Negative outcome
4. **TECHNOLOGY** → What capability arrived?
5. **MODIFIER** → When? (Add to baseline year)

**Generate Prompt:**
> "It's [YEAR]. [TECHNOLOGY] has [arrived early/been delayed/arrived] in [DOMAIN]. The outcome for [WELLBEING/subtitle] is [positive/negative]. What happened? What does this world look like?"

**Contemplation Time:** 3-5 minutes of journaling or silent reflection.

---

## Group Discussion Mode (3-8 players)

### Round Structure

**1. The Draw (2 min)**
- Facilitator draws cards publicly
- All players see the same scenario

**2. Silent Imagination (3 min)**
- Each player sketches their interpretation
- No discussion yet

**3. World-Building (10 min)**
- Players share visions round-robin
- Build on each other's ideas
- Identify common threads and divergences

**4. Synthesis (5 min)**
- Group identifies:
  - Most likely narrative
  - Most surprising narrative
  - Most concerning narrative
  - Most hopeful narrative

### Facilitation Prompts
- "Who benefits in this world? Who is harmed?"
- "What does a Tuesday morning look like?"
- "What job exists that doesn't exist today?"
- "What daily habit has changed?"
- "What do children learn in school?"

---

## Narrative Mode (Storytelling)

For more structured narrative play:

### Act Structure
Draw cards for three acts, creating a temporal progression:

**ACT I: Emergence (Draw 1)**
- Technology just arriving
- Early signals
- Initial disruption

**ACT II: Transformation (Draw 2)**
- Second technology compounds or conflicts
- Adaptation underway
- Stakes heighten

**ACT III: Resolution (Draw 3)**
- New equilibrium or continued chaos
- Long-term consequences
- Who adapted? Who didn't?

### Character Creation
Before beginning, each player creates a character:
- Name and age
- Relationship to the DOMAIN
- Personal stake in the WELLBEING factor
- How technology-literate are they?

---

## Strategic Mode (Scenario Planning)

For professional foresight workshops:

### Uncertainty Matrix
Draw 2 TECHNOLOGY cards. These become axes:
- X-axis: Tech A arrives early ← → delayed
- Y-axis: Tech B arrives early ← → delayed

This creates 4 quadrants. Draw DOMAIN and WELLBEING for each:
- **Q1:** Both early
- **Q2:** A early, B delayed
- **Q3:** A delayed, B early
- **Q4:** Both delayed

### Implications Mapping
For each quadrant, identify:
1. Key stakeholder impacts
2. Policy implications
3. Business opportunities/risks
4. Research priorities

---

## Temporal Layering (Advanced)

### Timeline Construction
Draw multiple TECH + MODIFIER pairs:

```
2025 ─────── 2027 ─────── 2029 ─────── 2032
   │           │           │           │
   └── Tech 1  └── Tech 2  └── Tech 3  └── Tech 4
       +Mod        +Mod        +Mod        +Mod
```

Narrate the progression:
- What changes between each milestone?
- How do earlier arrivals affect later ones?
- What path dependencies emerge?

### Fork Points
At each technology arrival, flip the outcome coin:
- Creates branching narratives
- Compare "timeline where X went well" vs "where it didn't"

---

## Wildcards

### When to Use
- **Scheduled:** Draw 1 wildcard per 3 rounds
- **Random:** 10% chance each round
- **Strategic:** Facilitator introduces for narrative interest

### Resolution
Wildcards override or modify existing cards:
- Follow the EFFECT text on the card
- May lock certain domains
- May shift all timelines
- May force outcome polarities

---

## Harmony/Dissonance Scoring

For evaluating scenario coherence:

### Harmony Indicators (+1 each)
- Technology and Domain have natural synergy
- Wellbeing outcome aligns with technology's nature
- Timeline is plausible given current trends
- Narrative elements reinforce each other

### Dissonance Indicators (+1 each)
- Technology seems mismatched to domain
- Outcome requires unlikely chain of events
- Timeline contradicts known development status
- Internal narrative contradictions

### Interpretation
- **High Harmony (3-4):** Likely scenario, useful for planning
- **Mixed (2):** Interesting edge case, worth exploring
- **High Dissonance (3-4):** Provocative scenario, challenges assumptions

### Integration Score
Rate 1-5: "How well do diverse elements integrate into a coherent whole?"
- 1: Forced, artificial combinations
- 3: Plausible with effort
- 5: Feels inevitable, elegant

---

## Variant: Debate Mode

### Setup
- Draw scenario as normal
- Divide into two teams: ADVOCATES and CRITICS

### Rounds
1. **ADVOCATES (5 min):** Present the most optimistic interpretation
2. **CRITICS (5 min):** Present the most pessimistic interpretation
3. **CROSS (5 min):** Each side challenges the other
4. **SYNTHESIS (5 min):** What's the realistic middle ground?

---

## Variant: Backcasting

### Reverse Play
1. Define a desired 2035 state (draw WELLBEING, must be positive)
2. Draw TECHNOLOGY cards
3. Work backwards: What had to happen for this future to arrive?
4. Identify decision points, investments, policies needed

---

## Design Notes

### Why Dutch Design?
The De Stijl aesthetic serves the game's purpose:
- **Grid structure** → Systems thinking, interconnection
- **Primary colors** → Clear categorization, no ambiguity
- **Geometric forms** → Abstract enough for imagination
- **Functional minimalism** → Focus on content, not decoration
- **Asymmetric balance** → Tension and harmony coexisting

### Card Ratios
- 10 Domains × 10 Wellbeing = 100 base combinations
- × 8 Technologies = 800 technology scenarios
- × 6 Modifiers = 4,800 timed scenarios
- × 2 Outcomes = 9,600 total scenarios
- + Wildcards = Effectively unlimited

### Facilitation Tips
1. **Silence is productive** — Don't rush imagination time
2. **"Yes, and..."** — Build on others' visions
3. **Name the assumptions** — Make implicit beliefs explicit
4. **Embrace dissonance** — The weird combinations often teach most
5. **Document insights** — Photograph card spreads, record discussions
